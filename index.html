            <h2><span class="blue-text-span">Reading and watching stuff</span> won't make you a pro</h2>

            <p>It's easy to find SQL resources online to <strong>learn about SQL syntax</strong>. It's much more difficult to <strong>practice real-world SQL problem-solving</strong>.</p>

            <p>Most resources out there suck at taking you from beginner to expert. They <strong>focus on syntax over practice</strong>. You spend hours watching Youtube videos, Udemy courses, and reading bible-sized books. And you are still not an expert. You often get stuck when faced with real-world SQL queries. You constantly have to interrupt your work and google around. You're  dependent on cheat sheets or random tutorials. You don‚Äôt have the muscle memory of a real expert.</p> 

            <p>The reason is simple. <strong>It‚Äôs not possible to become a great dancer by mostly watching dance videos and reading dance books</strong>. You need experience. You need practice. You need <strong>smart and abundant practice</strong>. Only <strong>deliberate practice</strong> will make things stick and make you <strong>think in SQL</strong>.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="lp-item">
            <h2>What if you could <span class="yellow-text-span">get good</span> at SQL in one week?</h2>
            <p>If there was a way to learn each SQL concept succinctly, then practice it thoroughly with scores of perfectly paced exercises from easy to advanced, <strong>you‚Äôd get crazy good pretty fast</strong>.</p>

            <p>Mastery happens when you solve a lot of increasingly difficult SQL problems with more and more advanced SQL queries. For that, you have to <strong>see how it's done by a pro then practice it yourself</strong> with carefully designed real-world problems and exercises.</p>

            <p>This is the best way to internalize all the concepts and <strong>develop your SQL muscle memory</strong>. No more need for constant googling, cheat sheets and endless Youtube tutorials. You‚Äôd write the most advanced SQL queries in a state of flow, without breaking a sweat.</p> 

            <p>With the right training program and dedicated effort, you can go from beginner to pro level in a week. That's where the <strong>Hardcore Week of SQL</strong> permanent bootcamp comes in.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="lp-item">
            <h2>Join the <span class="black-text-span">Hardcore Week of SQL</span> permanent bootcamp</h2>

            <p>My name is Isma√´l. I‚Äôve been a kind of false beginner in SQL for many years. I followed countless tutorials, watched tons of Youtube videos, and read many books. No luck, I was still struggling when faced with real-world SQL problems to solve.
            </p> 

            <p>I found that if I wanted to master SQL, I‚Äôd have to <strong>practice it deliberately, with tons of carefully designed exercises, with real-world use cases</strong>. It turns out such training resources are scarce and I had to brute-force my way into SQL proficiency.</p>

            <p>That‚Äôs why I've created the Hardcore Week of SQL with a team a great teachers. It‚Äôs a SQL training program that focuses on learning by practicing like an athlete. Here‚Äôs how it works:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Intensive live classes every weekday:</strong> during these live teaching sessions, we explain a core SQL concept and we practice for 8 hours. On Mondays we do <i>basic selections, aggregations, and common types and functions</i>. On Tuesdays we work on <i>joins, subqueries and set operations</i>. Wednesdays are for <i>modular queries (common table expressions, user-defined functions etc.)</i>. On Thursdays we binge on <i>window functions</i>. Finally, on Fridays we wrap things up with <i>several big, real-world analysis and data visualization projects</i>.</li>
              <li><strong>Over-the-shoulder learning:</strong> we introduce each concept with concise explanations and examples and you get to watch how we solve several practice problems step by step in real time. You can follow along by copying what we do and activate your muscle memory.</li>
              <li><strong>Abundant practice:</strong> each concept comes with a boatload of carefully paced practice problems, from easy to very hard.  By working through these problems, you develop skills equivalent to years of experience. Each problem is provided with a detailed step-by-step solution. New exercises are also added every week and sent to your inbox.</li>
              <li><strong>Real-world datasets:</strong> no more contrived, toy-like examples. You get to work on ecommerce stores datasets with real-world problems to solve.</li>
              <li><strong>Google BigQuery database:</strong> nothing to install on your computer. You work in a professional environment and query the datasets on the cloud using Google's cutting-edge SQL database.</li>
              <li><strong>Video recordings:</strong> the live classes and all exercises' solutions are recorded for easy reference at any time.</li>
              <li><strong>Projects:</strong> we provide you with bigger challenges you can later reuse at your day job or in your portfolio. Examples include basket analysis, buyer segmentation, cohort analysis projects. They all come with a complete solution and a real-world dataset.</li>
              <li><strong>Mentor and community support:</strong> you get access to a private community where you can post comments, ask questions and get answers from a team of SQL veterans.</li>
              <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> you can go hardcore: attend the live classes full time from Monday to Friday and get the skills and confidence you need in a week. Or you can do it over a longer period, attend the live classes when you can, and watch the recordings. This is a <strong>permanent bootcamp</strong> so you get lifetime access to the live classes, video recordings and other goodies.</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>How long do I have access to the program and its material?</strong>
            <p>The Hardcore Week of SQL is a permanent bootcamp, that means that when you join, you get permanent access to the live classes and all of the bootcamp's resources and material.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What flavor of SQL will I learn?</strong>
            <p>We'll be using the Google Standard SQL dialect on the Google BigQuery database. It shouldn't matter much as the small syntax variations that exist between database engines (Snowflake, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL etc.) are easy to pick up.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>Does the program cover database design, modification or administration topics?</strong>
            <p>No. The bootcamp focuses on analysis and reporting, i.e answering business questions with SELECT-based queries. We cover user-defined functions, table functions and stored procedures as they can be used to make better SELECT-based queries. But we don't include anything that create, update or delete database records.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What equipment and software do I need?</strong>
            <p>Many teaching programs, courses and books ask you to install some desktop database software and toy datasets. We don't. There are too many horror stories of students unable to install the software and staying stuck. We use the Google BigQuery console which is accessible with any web browser. Basically you only need a computer with an internet connection.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What is expected from me during the program?</strong>
            <p>To get the most out of the bootcamp, you should actively attend the live classes and do the practice exercises as well as the final projects. Asking and answering questions on the community Discord is also a good idea.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>I have a full-time job. Can I attend the training?</strong>
            <p><strong></strong>We know that life is busy. That's why we created a <strong>permanent bootcamp</strong>. That means that you  can hop in a live class whenever you have time, and take as much time as you need to complete the program. You could be done in a week if you can take a week off. Or you could take it more slowly and finish in six months or in a year. Also, you can always work asynchronously using the recorded lessons and exercises.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What will be the outcome of the bootcamp?</strong>
            <p>After completing the program, you'll be comfortable reading and writing advanced SQL queries for any of the following roles: data analyst, data engineer, analytics engineer, BI analyst, business analyst, web analyst, etc.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>Will I get an invoice?</strong>
            <p>Yes, we use Stripe for billing and send you an invoice automatically. If your company is paying for you and needs additional information on the invoice, such as company name and address, send us an email at hardcoreweek@userstand.com and we'll sort it out.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What if it doesn't work for me?</strong>
            <p>We want your investment in the bootcamp to be 100% risk-free. If you attend the live classes, do the practice exercises and yet are unsatisfied in any way, we will refund your purchase. However, part of what makes the Hardcore Week of SQL work is the financial accountability. If you do not attend the live classes and don't do the practice exercises, this does not qualify for a refund.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>Will my work pay for this?</strong>
            <p>Most employers are happy to pay for employee training that brings a return on investment. If you present it well, you might be able to get your employer to pay for you or reimburse you. Here's an example email you could send to your manager.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Hi {manager},</p><br><br>

            <p>I found this SQL bootcamp called the Hardcore Week of SQL. It's a live, intensive online course that can boost my SQL skills super fast. I'd like to enroll and put this new skills to good use here at {company_name}.</p>

            <p>Here are some key benefits:</p><br><br>

            <ul> 
              <li>40 hours of practice-focused teaching sessions every week</li>
              <li>Permanent access to the live teaching sessions</li>
              <li>Permanent access to the latest sessions' video recordings</li>
              <li>Permanent access to the graded exercises with their solutions</li>
              <li>Permanent access to the private community with members and teacher support</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The program costs $1200 USD (one-time fee). If you like, you can review course details here, including the instructors' bios: https://hardcoreweek.com/</p><br><br>
            <p>What do you think?</p><br><br>
            <p>Thanks,<br>{Your Name}</p><br><br>

            <p>P.S. It might also make sense for us to send a few folks from the team to this program as it would increase the team productivity as a whole even faster.</p>
