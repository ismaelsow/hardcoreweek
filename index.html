            <h2><span class="blue-text-span">Reading and watching stuff</span> won't make you a pro</h2>

            <p>It's easy to find SQL resources online to <strong>learn about SQL syntax</strong>. It's much more difficult to <strong>practice real-world SQL problem-solving</strong>.</p>

            <p>Most resources out there suck at taking you from beginner to expert. They <strong>focus on syntax over practice</strong>. You spend hours watching Youtube videos, Udemy courses, and reading bible-sized books. And you are still not an expert. You often get stuck when faced with real-world SQL queries. You constantly have to interrupt your work and google around. You're  dependent on cheat sheets or random tutorials. You don‚Äôt have the muscle memory of a real expert.</p> 

            <p>The reason is simple. <strong>It‚Äôs not possible to become a great dancer by mostly watching dance videos and reading dance books</strong>. You need experience. You need practice. You need <strong>smart and abundant practice</strong>. Only <strong>deliberate practice</strong> will make things stick and make you <strong>think in SQL</strong>.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="lp-item">
            <h2>What if you could <span class="yellow-text-span">get good</span> at SQL in one week?</h2>
            <p>If there was a way to learn each SQL concept succinctly, then practice it thoroughly with scores of perfectly paced exercises from easy to advanced, <strong>you‚Äôd get crazy good pretty fast</strong>.</p>

            <p>Mastery happens when you solve a lot of increasingly difficult SQL problems with more and more advanced SQL queries. For that, you have to practice with a lot of <strong>carefully designed real-world problems</strong>.</p>

            <p>This is the best way to internalize all the concepts and <strong>develop your SQL muscle memory</strong>. No more need for constant googling, cheat sheets and endless Youtube tutorials. You‚Äôll write the most advanced SQL queries in a state of flow, without breaking a sweat.</p> 

            <p>With the right training program and dedicated effort, you can go from beginner to pro level in a week. That's where the <strong>Hardcore Week of SQL</strong> bootcamp comes in.</p>

            <h2>Join the <span class="black-text-span">Hardcore Week of SQL</span> bootcamp</h2>

            <p>My name is Isma√´l. I‚Äôve been a false beginner in SQL for many years. I followed countless tutorials, watched tons of Youtube videos, and read many books. No luck, I was still struggling when faced with real-world SQL problems to solve.
            </p> 

            <p>I found that if I wanted to master SQL, I‚Äôd have to <strong>practice it deliberately, with tons of carefully designed exercises, with real-world use cases</strong>. It turns out such training resources are scarce and I had to brute-force my way into SQL proficiency.</p>

            <p>That‚Äôs why I've created the Hardcore Week of SQL with a team a great teachers. It‚Äôs a SQL training program that focuses on learning by practicing like an athlete. Here‚Äôs how it works:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Intensive live classes over one weekend:</strong> during these live teaching sessions, we explain all the essential SQL concepts and practice together for hours. On Saturdays we do <i>basic selections, aggregations, common types and functions, joins, subqueries, and set operations</i>. On Sundays, we wrap things up with <i>modular queries (common table expressions, user-defined functions etc.), and window functions</i>.</li>
              <li><strong>Over-the-shoulder learning:</strong> during the live classes, we introduce each concept with concise explanations and examples. You get to watch how we solve several practice problems step by step in real time. Then you solve a bunch of additional exercises on your own and activate your muscle memory.</li>
              <li><strong>Self-paced course with abundant practice:</strong> after the live classes, you get lifetime access to a private space with 50 lessons and 150+ exercises. You can go over them on your own time, at your own pace, and consolidate what you learned during the weekend live classes. Each lesson comes with carefully paced practice problems, from easy to hard. By working through these problems, you'll develop skills equivalent to years of experience. Each problem is provided with a complete solution. New exercises are added regularly and sent to your inbox.</li>
              <li><strong>Real-world database environment:</strong> you'll work with Google BigQuery, a professional cloud database. You'll query real world datasets using Google's cutting-edge SQL database. No more contrived, toy-like examples and datasets. Last but not least, nothing to install on your computer, no getting stuck trying to install your instructor's pet database package.</li>
              <li><strong>Video recordings:</strong> the live classes are recorded and timestamped for easy reference later.</li>
              <li><strong>Portfolio projects:</strong> you'll also get access to a hand-curated list of 100 datasets and 10 detailed project assignments you can use to build your portfolio.</li>
              <li><strong>Mentor and community support:</strong> you get access to a private community where you can post comments, ask questions and get answers from the teachers.</li>
              <li><strong>1:1 coaching call:</strong> get pro feedback during a one-hour call. You can choose your session to be a Mock SQL Interview, a Mock Job Interview, or a Resume Feedback session.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>The Hardcore Week of SQL is designed for people who are <strong>(1)</strong> starting jobs or interviewing for jobs where they will need to write a lot of advanced SQL SELECT queries <strong>AND (2)</strong> need to get to a pro level as quickly as possible. It's geared toward data analytics and business intelligence use cases, <strong>NOT</strong> software development or database administration.</p>
          <p>The program is called the <i>Hardcore Week of SQL</i> because if you do the work, you can get proficient in SQL in a week. It's intensive but effective. Definitively not for everybody üòâ

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>How long do I have access to the program and its material?</strong>
            <p>After the live classes, you get permanent access to all of the bootcamp's resources and material: recordings, lessons, exercises with solutions, extra-resources etc.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What flavor of SQL will I learn?</strong>
            <p>We'll be using the Google Standard SQL dialect on the Google BigQuery database. It shouldn't matter much as the syntax variations that exist between database engines (Snowflake, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL etc.) are small and easy to pick up.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>Does the program cover database design, modification or administration topics?</strong>
            <p>No. The bootcamp focuses on analysis and reporting, i.e answering business questions with SELECT-based queries. We cover user-defined functions, table functions, and views as they can be used to make better SELECT-based queries. We don't include anything that create, update or delete database records.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What equipment and software do I need?</strong>
            <p>Many teaching programs, courses and books ask you to install some desktop database software and toy datasets. We don't. There are too many horror stories of students unable to install the software and staying stuck. For the database, we use Google BigQuery. The live classes are taught over Google Meet. Both BigQuery and Meet have free plans and are browser-based. Bottom line: you only need a computer with an internet connection, and a Gmail account.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What is expected from me during the program?</strong>
            <p>To get the most out of the bootcamp, you should actively attend the live classes and do the practice exercises. Asking and answering questions on the community Discord is also a good idea.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>I have a full-time job. Will it work for me?</strong>
            <p><strong></strong>We know that life is busy. That's why the live classes are done <strong> during the weekend</strong>. Then you can consolidate your skills whenever you have time, using the recorded lessons and exercises. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What will be the outcome of the bootcamp?</strong>
            <p>After completing the program, you'll be comfortable reading and writing advanced SQL queries for any of the following roles: data analyst, data engineer, analytics engineer, BI analyst, business analyst, web analyst, etc.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>How does the coaching call work?</strong>
            <p>After joining the program, you'll be able to book a call with one of our teachers. You can choose between a mock SQL interview, a mock job interview, or a resume feedback session. Before the meeting we'll send you the exact agenda and info on how to prepare.  We'll also ask you a few questions about your goals and background. We'll use that information to make the call as tailored as possible. The coaching call lasts up to one hour and is conducted over Google Meet.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>Will I get an invoice?</strong>
            <p>Yes, we use Stripe for billing and send you an invoice automatically. If your company is paying for you and needs additional information on the invoice, such as company name and address, send us an email at hardcoreweek@userstand.com and we'll sort it out.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What if it doesn't work for me?</strong>
            <p>We want your investment in the bootcamp to be 100% risk-free. If you attend the live classes, do the practice exercises and yet are unsatisfied in any way, we will refund your purchase. However, part of what makes the Hardcore Week of SQL work is the financial accountability. If you do not attend the live classes and don't do the practice exercises, this does not qualify for a refund.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>Will my work pay for this?</strong>
            <p>Most employers are happy to pay for employee training that brings a return on investment. If you present it well, you might be able to get your employer to pay for you or reimburse you. Here's an example email you could send to your manager.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Hi {manager},</p><br><br>

            <p>I found this SQL bootcamp called the Hardcore Week of SQL. It's a live, intensive online course that can boost my SQL skills super fast. I'd like to enroll and put this new skills to good use here at {company_name}.</p>

              <li>Permanent access to the live teaching sessions</li>

            <p>Thanks,<br>{Your Name}</p><br><br>

            <p>P.S. It might also make sense for us to send a few folks from the team to this program as it would increase the team productivity as a whole even faster.</p>
