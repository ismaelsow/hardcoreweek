            <p><span style="font-weight:800">Hi there üëã</span></p>
            <p>There are many good reasons to learn how to query data with SQL. You might want to <strong>land a better job</strong>. You might want to <strong>get better at your job</strong>. In any case, the faster you master SQL, the more successful you will be.</p>
            <p>The problem?</p>

          <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
          <div class="lp-item">
            <h2><span class="red-text-span">Watching stuff</span> won't make you great</h2>

            <p>Most resources out there suck at taking you from beginner to expert. They <strong>focus on concepts over practice</strong>. You spend hours watching Youtube videos and reading bible-sized books. And you are still not an expert. You often get stuck when facing a real-world SQL query. You constantly have to interrupt your work and google around. You're  dependent on cheat sheets or Youtube tutorials. You don‚Äôt have the muscle memory of a real expert.</p> 

            <p>The reason is simple. <strong>It‚Äôs not possible to become a great dancer by mostly watching dance videos and reading dance books</strong>. You have to practice. You have to practice <strong>smartly and abundantly</strong>. Only deliberate practice will make things stick and give you a solid grip on SQL.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- What if you could practice SQL like Michael Jordan? -->
          <div class="lp-item">
            <h2>What if you could <span class="green-text-span">practice</span> SQL like an athlete?</h2>
            <p>If there was a way to learn each SQL concept atomically, then practice it thoroughly, before going to the next concept, <strong>you‚Äôd get crazy good pretty fast</strong>. And if you could learn and practice all SQL concepts this way, you‚Äôll become formidable at SQL at lightning speed.</p>

            <p>You‚Äôd internalize all the concepts and <strong>develop your muscle memory</strong>. No need for constant Googling, cheat sheets and endless Youtube tutorials. You‚Äôd write even the most advanced SQL queries in a state of flow, without breaking a sweat.</p> 
          </div>

            <h2>Practice like Jordan with the <span class="blue-text-span">SQL Boss training program</span></h2>

            <p>My name is Isma√´l (‚û°Ô∏è  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismaelsow/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>) and I‚Äôve been a false beginner in SQL for most of my professional life. I followed countless tutorials, watched tons of Youtube videos, and read many books. No luck, I was still struggling when faced with real-world SQL problems to solve.
            </p> 

            <p>I found that if I wanted to master SQL, I‚Äôd have to <strong>practice it deliberately, with a truckload of carefully designed exercises, with real-world use cases</strong>. It turns out such training resources were rare. That‚Äôs why I'm building SQL Boss. It‚Äôs an SQL training program that focuses on learning by practicing like an athlete. Here‚Äôs how it works:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Intense practice:</strong> each concept and screencast comes with a boatload of exercises. Each exercise has a video explaining the solution in great detail.</li>
              <li><strong>Careful pacing:</strong> we introduce one concept at a time and make you master it before introducing the next one.</li>
              <li><strong>Google Merchandise Store analytics dataset:</strong> no more contrived, unrealistic examples. You get to work on an actual ecommerce store dataset with real-world problems to solve.</li>
              <li><strong>Google BigQuery database:</strong> nothing to install on your computer, you query the dataset on the cloud using Google cutting-edge SQL database (and you get to add a cool buzzword to your CV).</li>
              <li><strong>Mentor and community support:</strong> you get access to a private community where you can post comments, ask questions and get answers from me and a team of SQL veterans.</li>
            </ul>
