Hi {NAME},

Are you missing important info? News, blog posts, newsletters, podcasts, social media updates, books, research reports, etc. There's a lot, and it's hard to keep up.

What if you could stay on top of the content that matters to you with less effort? Everything about {COMPANY}’s market, or any personal interest you'd like to monitor.

We help CEOs with their content diet. We binge on their favorite sources and give them a synthesis. It's like receiving a personal presidential brief. Our clients save an average of 10 hours each week and feel more informed.

How does it work? You give us a list of topics and sources, and we select sharp analysts with relevant expertise. The result? A daily memo, and hours of your life back.

Is it something you’d want? Let me know, and I’ll set up a quick call. Onboarding is fast. We know your time is expensive.

Best,
